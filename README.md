# My Free Code Camp Frontend Libraries Certification Projects

See this site live at [https://fcc-js-frameworks-projects.patrickmccartney.dev/](https://fcc-js-frameworks-projects.patrickmccartney.dev/)

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to complete the [Free Code Camp Frontend Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). The course covers [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). For the final projects I chose [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) since I usually use [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) for work, but you should be able to use any framework and Astro supports quite a few.
