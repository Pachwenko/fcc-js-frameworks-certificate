# My Free Code Camp Frontend Libraries Certification Projects

See this site live at [https://stoic-leakey-17456a.netlify.app/](https://stoic-leakey-17456a.netlify.app/)

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to complete the [Free Code Camp Frontend Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). The course covers [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). For the final projects I chose [React](https://reactjs.org/) since I was curious what the hype has been about, but you should be able to use any framework and Astro supports quite a few.

## Development

- `yarn install` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Deployment

- `yarn build` or `npm build`
- The `dist` folder can now be uploaded or served wherever you like.

This site is currently deploy with Netlify (Astro is incompatible w/ Github Pages currently)
